## Overview

#### Dropdown Menu

This is a practice for dropdown menu using JavaScript and CSS. It is a part of the assignment for The Odin Project. When user clicks the button, it toggles the dropdown menu. JavaScript code is reusable so that it can be used in other projects.

#### Carousel

The photo gallery is in the form of a slideshow with buttons to go to the previous and next slides.  It also has a dot navigation - by clicking a specific dot, user can go to the specific slide. Also the carousel will automatically go to the next slide every 5 seconds.
